<h2>Talent Show Frenzy</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
my mixes in keyboard inputs as well as music to give the simulation of a dancing frenzy at a talent show
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
using the keyboard to generate the dancing images, as well as playing a song throughout the time period of playing the game itself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
what i learned was how to finally implement sound as background music as that was what i was having troble with in my other games.
the hardest part was debugging the music, and ensuring the sprites were placed in a way that it wasnt confusing.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
i borrowed all assets involved in the game, all 5 dancing images with citations are listed below. as well as the phaser code for keyboard inputs calling functions

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    It resembles the Phaser example that i posted above in my citations
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    simple hotkey based game that produces dancing images
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Talent Show
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
input is all keyboard based.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that is being shown is tying the keyboard to specific functions which in this case is producing images
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Mindless Fun, no real purpose or goal
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
pressing any of the hotkeys produces a dancing image that is tied to that, producing a canvas of dancing characters
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Nothing specifically just random button pressing
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
Placed at a talent show/concert and dancing around the screen
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
those who just want a mindless game/activity to play</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
however long you want to display images.</li>
