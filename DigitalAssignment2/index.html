<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
i followed the theme of "chicken" and decided to make a simple click puzzle solving the picture of a rooster/chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
there isnt anything particularly fancy in regards to the techincallity, but there is a lot of logic/function calling that goes on
to ensure that it all flows well
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
generating a background that is also the play space was interesting. the hardest part was getting the pieces sized right, as i totally forgot
about the game window size and realized that needed to be equivalent to the photos dimenstions

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
i used the rooster photo off google, and a lot of the code is from phasers puzzle game, the sound byte i wanted to introduce sadly dont seem to work.<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
i borrowed most of the foundation from phaser as it seemed simple enough yet had a lot to learn about how everything actually flowed, which was a learning experience.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Simple click based puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse clicks is the way to play the game, clicking a space next to the black space shifts it over until you solve the puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
mouse clicking, and shifting of objects on the screen. also the use of Tweens which we were shown briefly in class.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Simple fun, nothing competitive, mindless
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
all gameplay is based off the user clicking the mouse cursor on a space that is right next to the empty one to solve the puzzle.
i wasnt able to implement the sound bits in time, and wanted to add an additional level as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Nothing Special to be done. just have fun
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who are bored and want a simple puzzle to click around</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
took me a while as most of these kind of puzzles do maybe 5-10 min.
</li>
